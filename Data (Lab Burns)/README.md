## Experimental Fire Spread Videos : Slope Effect Study

This link [https://ln5.sync.com/dl/f5c267b00#zkjgai95-ht6fx2xm-ktszmnbk-fa7p89jw] contains videos from controlled laboratory burns conducted on varying slope degrees (5Â°â€“50Â°, in 5Â° increments; note: 35Â° is missing). Each folder corresponds to a specific slope degree and includes videos capturing the spread dynamics under that condition.

These experiments were conducted by Geoffrey Goetz at the University of British Columbia, Okanagan campus to investigate how slope influences fire spread.
The recordings were later systematically analyzed to model directional fire spread, as presented in our research paper.

For detailed information about the experimental design, data collection  please refer to the full description in Geoff's Masters thesis:
